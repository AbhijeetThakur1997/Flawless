<h1>Official me</h1>
<h3>My name is Abhijeet Thakur</h3>
<p><strong>I am Abhijeet Thakur
  I have completed my 12th standard in science stream from ST.XAVVIER's SCHOOL.
  After 12 th I did one and a half year certification course in ASP.net
  After that I joined Angel as a position of Intern.
  I have been working with this company since 1 year and a half.
  My job role has been to manage networking side.
  As a student I have always been interested in the practical application and relevance
  of the knowledge gained during my academics. Accordingly I decided to build my
  career in the field of computers where the learning takes place more through
  practical exposure than the theoretical knowledge. Moreover, international
  education offers good amount of practical exposure of the subjects.
  Hence I had decided to go abroad for myfurther studies in the field of computers.
  And right now i am in 1st year of Bachelor of Computer Science.</strong>

<h1>Unofficial me</h1>

    My hobbies are playing Guitar, Listening Music, and yes sometimes Coding too.
    sports: Horse Riding, Swimming, Volleyball.
